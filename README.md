  ## Description
  - This JavaScript application allows the user to input information about their team in order to create a basic website for their project. The application allows for multiple Interns and Employees to be added in addition to the manager of the project. once the application has finished, the final HTML file will be located within the 'dist' directory along with the linked stylesheet.
  ### Challenges and Application
  - The most challenging part of this assignment for me was figuring out how to reference information from different files using 
        
        module.exports
  - In addition, this project required the use of class constructors in order to create variations on the original 

        Employee
      class. By using OOP (Object Oriented Programming), this task becomes much more efficient than it would be through the use of conventional JavaScript.
  - I plan on adding more in terms of the actual styling of the generated webpage. As of now, the look is very rough but legible.
  ## Installation
  - To install, the user must clone the repository from GitHub and then initialize npm, along with installing both jest and inquirer (v8.2.4). After this, the program can be run by entering node index.js into the CLI once you have navigated to the correct directory.
  ## Usage
  - The user only needs to input information through the command line and interact with selections using the arrow keys. Selections can be made using the "return" or "enter" key.
  ## Testing
  - For testing, simply enter npm test into the command line once jest has been installed.
